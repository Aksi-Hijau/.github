Project Description
Aksi Hijau is a crowdfunding application with a focus on reducing the potential for climate crisis by protecting and caring for the environment. The focus of our application is to invite everyone, both individuals and communities who care about the environment, to actively participate in fighting the climate crisis which has an impact on nature. 

Aksi Hijau invites each community to be active in creating campaigns and conducting outreach together with donors in tree planting actions in the campaign area.

Our repositories is a merger from 3 different repositories created by each learning path

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
